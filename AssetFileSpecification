Game levels will be specified by a Level file, which will contain a list of entity
specifications, one per line. It will also contain a single line which specifies
properties of the player in that level. In this way, you can define an entire
level in the data file, rather than in programming code. The syntax of the lines
of the lines of the Level file are as follows.

IMPORTANT NOTE:
    All (GX, GY) positions given in the level specification file are given in
    'grid' coordinates. The 'grid' cells are of size 64 by 64 pixels, and the
    entity should be positioned such that the bottom left corner of its texture
    is aligned with the bottom-left of the screen, and can be seen by pressing
    the 'G' key while the game is running

Tile Entity Specification:
Tile N GX GY
    Animation Name      N       std::string (Animation asset name for this tile)
    GX Grid X Pos       GX      float
    GY Grid Y Pos       GY      float

Decoration Entity Specification:
Dec N X Y
    Animation Name      N       std::string (Animation asset name for this tile)
    X Position          X       float
    Y Position          Y       float

Player Specification-
Player GX GY CW CH SX SY SM GY B
    GX, GY Grid Pos     X, Y    float, float (starting position of player)
    BoundingBox W/H     CW, CH  float, float

Control files will specify the controls for the game. The file will contain a list
of control specifications, one per line. The syntax of the lines of the Control file
are as follows.

Control Specification:
